# Locker [WIP]

## Key Concepts

### 1. **Self-Hosted by Default**

Your secrets never leave your infrastructure. No third-party cloud, no vendor lock-in, no "trust us with your data." You control the hardware, the network, and the encryption keys.

### 2. **One Binary, Two Modes**

A single `locker` binary handles both personal development and team collaboration. Run `locker server --dev` for instant local work with in-memory storage, or deploy the full Docker stack for team-wide secret management with Web UI and audit logs.

## Quick Start
